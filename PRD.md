# Product Requirements Document: AI Language Tutor Voice Agent

### 1. Introduction and Vision 🗣️

This document outlines the product requirements for an AI-powered Language Tutor, a Next.js web application designed to teach a new language (Language A) to a user who is fluent in another (Language B). The core of the experience is a voice-driven conversation where the AI agent, speaking primarily in Language B, guides the user through structured lessons to learn Language A. The platform will leverage the advanced speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities of the ElevenLabs API to create a natural and interactive learning environment.

**The vision** is to create a personalized, accessible, and engaging language learning tool that feels less like a traditional app and more like conversing with a patient, knowledgeable tutor.

### 2. Goals and Objectives 🎯

* **Primary Goal:** To effectively teach a user the fundamentals of a new language (Language A) through interactive voice conversations.
* **Secondary Goal:** To provide a backend system that allows for easy creation, management, and editing of lesson plans, making the platform scalable and adaptable.
* **User Experience Goal:** To deliver a low-latency, seamless, and natural-sounding conversational experience that keeps users engaged.
* **Technical Goal:** To build a robust and scalable full-stack application using Next.js and the ElevenLabs Agents Platform.

### 3. Target Audience 👥

The primary target audience is individuals who are native speakers of one language (e.g., Hindi) and wish to learn another (e.g., English) from a beginner level. They are likely looking for a more practical, conversation-based learning method over traditional textbook or app-based approaches.

### 4. Product Features & Functionality

#### **Core Voice Interaction & Learning Experience**

* **Bilingual Conversation:** The agent will primarily communicate in the user's native language (Language B) to explain concepts, give instructions, and provide feedback. It will introduce words and phrases from the target language (Language A) as part of the lesson.
  * **Language Selection:** Users must be able to select their conversation language (Language B - e.g., Hindi, Spanish, French) and their target learning language (Language A - e.g., English).
  * **Mixed Language Input:** The system should handle user responses that mix both languages (e.g., a Hindi-speaking user responding mostly in Hindi with English phrases they're learning).
  * **Configurable per User:** Each user can have their own language preference stored in their profile.
* **Speech-to-Text (STT):** The system will use ElevenLabs' ASR model to accurately transcribe the user's spoken responses in both Language A and Language B. The STT must support multi-language detection to handle mixed-language responses.
* **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** All agent dialogue will be generated using ElevenLabs' high-quality, low-latency TTS, offering a wide variety of voices to keep the experience engaging. The TTS should use appropriate language models based on the user's selected conversation language.
* **Pronunciation Feedback (Future Scope):** While initial implementation will focus on comprehension, a future version could leverage STT analysis to provide basic feedback on the user's pronunciation of Language A.
* **Lesson Progression:** The agent will guide the user through a pre-defined sequence of lessons, tracking their progress and adapting to their pace.
* **Progress Management:** Users should have the ability to reset their progress across all lessons for testing and practice purposes.

#### **Lesson Management System**

* **Dynamic Lesson Structure:** Lessons should not be hard-coded. They will be stored in a database and fetched by the backend.
* **Editable Content:** A simple admin interface or a CMS (Content Management System) should allow non-technical users to create, read, update, and delete lessons.
* **Lesson Components:** Each lesson should be broken down into structured steps or "turns." For example:
    * `step_id`: Unique identifier for the step.
    * `lesson_id`: Which lesson this step belongs to.
    * `agent_prompt_b`: The text the agent speaks in Language B (e.g., "Now, let's learn how to say 'hello' in English.").
    * `target_phrase_a`: The word or phrase to be taught in Language A (e.g., "Hello").
    * `expected_user_response`: The ideal response from the user (can be flexible).
    * `success_feedback`: What the agent says if the user is correct (e.g., "That's right!").
    * `failure_feedback`: What the agent says if the user is incorrect (e.g., "Not quite, let's try again. The word is 'Hello'.").
    * `next_step_id`: The ID of the next step in the lesson.

### 5. System Architecture

#### **Frontend (Client-Side)**

* **Framework:** **Next.js** (React)
* **UI:** A clean, minimalist interface focused on the voice interaction. It should include:
    * A prominent "Push to Talk" button.
    * Visual feedback to indicate when the agent is listening, processing, or speaking.
    * A text transcript of the conversation for user reference.
    * A simple display of the current lesson and user progress (e.g., "Lesson 1: Greetings").
    * Language selection dropdown or settings (to choose conversation language and target learning language).
    * A "Reset Progress" button to allow users to restart all lessons from the beginning.
* **State Management:** Use React's Context API or a library like Zustand for managing application state (e.g., conversation history, loading status).
* **ElevenLabs Integration:** The frontend will capture microphone input and send it to the backend. It will receive audio streams from the backend to play back the agent's responses.

#### **Backend (Server-Side)**

* **Framework:** **Next.js API Routes** or a standalone **Node.js** server (e.g., with Express).
* **Database:** A relational database like **PostgreSQL** or a NoSQL database like **MongoDB** to store user data and lesson content.
    * **Tables/Collections:**
        * `Users`: To store user profiles and progress.
        * `Lessons`: To store the overall lesson structure.
        * `LessonSteps`: To store the individual conversational turns within each lesson.
* **API Endpoints:**
    * `POST /api/conversation`: The main endpoint to handle user speech. It receives the audio or transcribed text, processes the logic, and returns the agent's audio response.
    * `GET /api/lessons`: To fetch the list of lessons for the user.
    * `GET /api/lessons/:id`: To fetch the specific steps for a given lesson.
* **ElevenLabs Agent Integration:**
    * The backend will be the primary interface with the **ElevenLabs Agents Platform**.
    * When the user speaks, the backend receives the transcribed text from the frontend or directly from the ElevenLabs STT service.
    * It will fetch the current lesson step from the database.
    * It will use this information to decide what the agent should say next.
    * It will then call the ElevenLabs TTS API to generate the audio for the agent's response and stream it back to the frontend.
