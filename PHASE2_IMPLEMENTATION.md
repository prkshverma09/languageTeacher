# Phase 2 Implementation - Natural Conversational UI

**Date:** October 6, 2025
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Removed Push-to-Talk Interface ✅
- Completely removed the old "Push to Talk" button

- Removed manual audio recording logic
- Removed old transcript display with gibberish text

### 2. Implemented Natural Conversation UI ✅

#### New Components Created:

**`AudioWaveform.tsx`**
- Animated audio waveform visualizer
- Shows when agent is speaking (blue waveform)
- Shows when user is speaking (green waveform)
- Smooth animations using HTML5 Canvas

**Updated `LessonClient.tsx`**
- Complete rewrite for agent-based conversations
- Integrated ElevenLabs Conversational AI SDK (`@elevenlabs/client`)
- WebSocket-based continuous conversation
- Real-time connection status indicator
- Start/End Conversation buttons
- Dual audio waveforms instead of text transcript

#### Key Features:

1. **Agent Initialization:**
   - Automatically initializes agent when lesson loads
   - Creates agent with lesson knowledge base
   - Shows "Initializing Agent..." status

2. **Conversation Controls:**
   - Simple "Start Conversation" button
   - "End Conversation" button when connected
   - Connection status indicator with colors:
     - 🟢 Green: Connected
     - 🟡 Yellow: Connecting (pulsing)
     - 🔴 Red: Error
     - ⚪ Gray: Disconnected

3. **Audio Waveforms:**
   - **Agent Speaking** (Blue waveform): Active when agent talks
   - **You Speaking** (Green waveform): Active when user talks
   - Smooth animations showing audio activity
   - No more gibberish transcript text

4. **Natural Conversation:**
   - No push-to-talk required
   - Agent greets user automatically
   - Agent explains lesson objectives
   - User can interrupt agent at any time
   - Supports natural back-and-forth conversation

5. **Session Management:**
   - Creates conversation record in database
   - Tracks conversation duration
   - Saves session data when ended

## Files Modified

### New Files:
1. **`src/components/AudioWaveform.tsx`** - Audio visualization component
2. **`PHASE2_IMPLEMENTATION.md`** - This document

### Updated Files:
1. **`src/components/LessonClient.tsx`** - Complete rewrite for agent-based UI
2. **`src/app/lessons/[id]/page.tsx`** - Updated to pass simplified lesson data
3. **`package.json`** - Added `@elevenlabs/client` dependency

---

## How the New Flow Works

### Old Flow (Removed):
```
1. User presses "Push to Talk" button
2. User speaks while holding button
3. User releases button
4. Audio sent to backend
5. Backend processes and responds
6. Text transcript shown
```

### New Flow (Implemented):
```
1. User clicks "Start Conversation"
2. Agent automatically greets user and explains lesson
3. User speaks naturally (no button needed)
4. Agent responds naturally
5. User can interrupt agent anytime
6. Conversation continues until user clicks "End Conversation"
7. Audio waveforms show who's speaking in real-time
```

## UI Changes

### Before:
- ❌ Push to Talk button (hold to speak)
- ❌ Text transcript showing encoded text
- ❌ "Current Task" showing expected answer
- ❌ Step-by-step progression
- ❌ Success/failure indicators

### After:
- ✅ Start/End Conversation buttons
- ✅ Two animated audio waveforms
- ✅ Connection status indicator
- ✅ Instructions panel explaining how to use
- ✅ No visible lesson steps (agent handles it)
- ✅ Clean, minimal interface

---

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Start the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Navigate to a Lesson
Go to: `http://localhost:3000/lessons/1`

### 3. Test the Conversation Flow

**Expected Behavior:**

1. **On Page Load:**
   - Should see "Initializing Agent..." status
   - After a few seconds, should see "Not Connected" status
   - "Start Conversation" button should be enabled

2. **When Clicking "Start Conversation":**
   - Status changes to "Connecting..." (yellow, pulsing)
   - Then changes to "Connected - Agent is ready" (green)
   - Button changes to "End Conversation" (red)
   - Agent should automatically start speaking:
     - In your conversation language (e.g., Hindi if set)
     - Greeting you
     - Explaining what the lesson will teach
   - Agent waveform (blue) should animate when agent speaks

3. **During Conversation:**
   - Just speak naturally (no button press needed)
   - User waveform (green) should animate when you speak
   - Agent responds to your speech
   - You can interrupt agent mid-sentence
   - Ask questions, request clarification, practice phrases

4. **When Clicking "End Conversation":**
   - Connection closes gracefully
   - Waveforms stop animating
   - Status returns to "Not Connected"
   - Conversation data saved to database

## What to Expect from the Agent

### Agent Should:
✅ Greet you in your conversation language
✅ Explain the lesson objectives clearly
✅ Teach multiple phrases (5-7 phrases per lesson)
✅ Provide examples and usage context
✅ Respond to questions naturally
✅ Handle interruptions gracefully
✅ Adapt to your pace
✅ Provide encouragement and feedback

### Agent Should NOT:
❌ Only teach one word/phrase
❌ Follow rigid step-by-step script
❌ Ignore questions or interruptions
❌ Switch to the target language (except when teaching phrases)
❌ Be robotic or scripted

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Failed to initialize agent"
**Possible Causes:**
- ElevenLabs API key not set or invalid
- API key doesn't have Conversational AI access
- Backend server not running

**Solution:**
1. Check `.env` file has `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`
2. Verify API key has Agents Platform access
3. Check console for error details

### Issue: Connection fails when clicking "Start Conversation"
**Possible Causes:**
- Agent not created successfully
- WebSocket connection blocked
- Browser microphone permissions denied

**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Ensure microphone permissions granted
3. Check network tab for WebSocket connections
4. Try refreshing the page

### Issue: Waveforms not animating
**Possible Causes:**
- Audio not being detected
- Microphone not working
- Canvas rendering issue

**Solution:**
1. Check microphone is connected and working
2. Grant microphone permissions to browser
3. Try a different browser

### Issue: Agent not speaking or greeting
**Possible Causes:**
- Agent knowledge base not loaded
- Lesson data not properly formatted
- System prompt not working

**Solution:**
1. Check backend logs for agent creation
2. Verify lesson data has translations
3. Check console for API errors

## Technical Details

### ElevenLabs Conversational AI SDK

The new implementation uses `@elevenlabs/client` which provides:

```typescript
import { Conversation } from '@elevenlabs/client';

const conversation = await Conversation.startSession({
  agentId: 'your-agent-id',
  onConnect: () => { /* handle connection */ },
  onDisconnect: () => { /* handle disconnection */ },
  onError: (error) => { /* handle errors */ },
  onModeChange: (mode) => {
    // mode.mode can be: 'speaking', 'listening', 'thinking'
    // Use this to animate waveforms
  },
});

// End the conversation
await conversation.endSession();
```

### Audio Waveform Animation

Uses HTML5 Canvas with requestAnimationFrame for smooth 60fps animations:

```typescript
const animate = () => {
  // Clear canvas
  ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

  // Draw animated bars
  barsRef.current.forEach((height, index) => {
    if (isActive) {
      // Animate with random wave motion
      barsRef.current[index] += (Math.random() - 0.5) * 0.3;
    } else {
      // Gradually decrease
      barsRef.current[index] *= 0.95;
    }

    // Draw bar
    ctx.fillRect(x, y, barWidth, barHeight);
  });

  requestAnimationFrame(animate);
};
```

---

## Database Integration

### Conversation Tracking

Every conversation session is now tracked in the database:

```typescript
// Start conversation
POST /api/conversations/start
{
  lessonId: 1
}

// End conversation
POST /api/conversations/complete
{
  conversationId: 123,
  duration: 850,  // seconds
  metadata: { ended: 'manual' }
}
```

### Agent Association

Each user has their own agent:
- Agent created/updated when lesson loads
- Agent has lesson knowledge base
- Agent configuration stored in database
- Agent reused across sessions
