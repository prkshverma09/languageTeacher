# Product Requirements Document: AI Language Tutor Voice Agent

### 1. Introduction and Vision üó£Ô∏è

This document outlines the product requirements for an AI-powered Language Tutor, a Next.js web application designed to teach a new language (Language A) to a user who is fluent in another (Language B). The core of the experience is a **natural, free-flowing voice conversation** with an AI agent that speaks in Language B to teach Language A. The platform leverages the **ElevenLabs Agents Platform** to create truly conversational, interruptible, and contextually-aware learning sessions that feel like talking to a real tutor.

**The vision** is to create a personalized, accessible, and engaging language learning tool that feels like having a natural conversation with a patient, knowledgeable tutor who adapts to your questions, pace, and learning style in real-time.

### 2. Goals and Objectives üéØ

* **Primary Goal:** To effectively teach a user the fundamentals of a new language (Language A) through interactive voice conversations.
* **Secondary Goal:** To provide a backend system that allows for easy creation, management, and editing of lesson plans, making the platform scalable and adaptable.
* **User Experience Goal:** To deliver a low-latency, seamless, and natural-sounding conversational experience that keeps users engaged.
* **Technical Goal:** To build a robust and scalable full-stack application using Next.js and the ElevenLabs Agents Platform.

### 3. Target Audience üë•

The primary target audience is individuals who are native speakers of one language (e.g., Hindi) and wish to learn another (e.g., English) from a beginner level. They are likely looking for a more practical, conversation-based learning method over traditional textbook or app-based approaches.

### 4. Product Features & Functionality

#### **Core Voice Interaction & Learning Experience**

* **Natural Conversational Flow:** The agent will engage in **natural, free-flowing conversations** without requiring users to press a "push to talk" button. The conversation should feel organic and continuous, powered by the ElevenLabs Agents Platform.
  * **Always-On Listening:** The agent is always ready to listen and respond, creating a seamless conversational experience.
  * **Interruptible:** Users can interrupt the agent at any time to ask questions, clarify concepts, or provide responses.
  * **Context-Aware:** The agent maintains conversation context and adapts responses based on the ongoing dialogue.

* **Bilingual Conversation:** The agent will **ALWAYS communicate in the user's native language (Language B)** to explain concepts, give instructions, and provide feedback. It will teach words and phrases from the target language (Language A) as part of the lesson.
  * **Example:** A Hindi speaker learning English will hear: *"‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á! ‡§Ü‡§ú ‡§π‡§Æ ‡§Ö‡§Ç‡§ó‡•ç‡§∞‡•á‡§ú‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§Ö‡§≠‡§ø‡§µ‡§æ‡§¶‡§® ‡§∏‡•Ä‡§ñ‡•á‡§Ç‡§ó‡•á‡•§ ‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§Ü‡§™ ‡§§‡•à‡§Ø‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç? ‡§ö‡§≤‡§ø‡§è 'Hello' ‡§∏‡•á ‡§∂‡•Å‡§∞‡•Ç ‡§ï‡§∞‡§§‡•á ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç‡•§"* (Hello! Today we'll learn greetings in English. Are you ready? Let's start with 'Hello'.)
  * **Language Selection:** Users select their conversation language (Language B - Hindi, Spanish, French) and target learning language (Language A - English) in their profile.
  * **Mixed Language Input:** The agent naturally handles responses mixing both languages (e.g., a Hindi speaker responding in Hindi with English phrases they're learning).
  * **Configurable per User:** Each user's language preferences are stored in their profile and used to configure their personal learning agent.
  * **Content Localization:** ALL lesson content and agent instructions are available in the user's conversation language.

* **Lesson Greeting & Introduction:** When a user starts a lesson, the agent automatically greets them and explains what the lesson will teach.
  * **Example:** *"‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á! ‡§Ü‡§ú ‡§ï‡•á ‡§™‡§æ‡§† ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§π‡§Æ ‡§¶‡•à‡§®‡§ø‡§ï ‡§ú‡•Ä‡§µ‡§® ‡§ï‡•á ‡§Æ‡§π‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡§™‡•Ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§£ ‡§µ‡§æ‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Ç‡§∂ ‡§∏‡•Ä‡§ñ‡•á‡§Ç‡§ó‡•á - ‡§ú‡•à‡§∏‡•á ‡§ï‡§ø ‡§™‡§∞‡§ø‡§ö‡§Ø, ‡§Ö‡§≠‡§ø‡§µ‡§æ‡§¶‡§®, ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§ß‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡§µ‡§æ‡§¶ ‡§ï‡•à‡§∏‡•á ‡§ï‡§∞‡•á‡§Ç‡•§ ‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§Ü‡§™ ‡§∂‡•Å‡§∞‡•Ç ‡§ï‡§∞‡§®‡•á ‡§ï‡•á ‡§≤‡§ø‡§è ‡§§‡•à‡§Ø‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç?"* (Hello! In today's lesson, we'll learn important daily life phrases - like introductions, greetings, and how to say thank you. Are you ready to start?)

* **Flexible Lesson Guidance:** Lessons serve as **guidance rather than strict scripts**, allowing the agent to:
  * Adapt to user questions and tangential discussions
  * Maintain focus on lesson objectives while allowing natural conversation flow
  * Redirect gently when conversation strays too far from learning goals
  * Provide additional examples or explanations based on user needs
  * Repeat or rephrase concepts when users show confusion

* **Extended Lesson Structure:** Lessons teach **multiple related concepts** in a single session rather than single words or phrases:
  * A "Greetings" lesson might cover: Hello, Good morning, How are you?, Thank you, Goodbye
  * A "Restaurant" lesson might cover: ordering food, asking for the bill, dietary restrictions, complimenting the chef
  * Each lesson lasts 10-20 minutes with natural conversation flow

* **Question & Interruption Handling:** Users can freely:
  * Ask questions about pronunciation, grammar, or usage
  * Request clarification or repetition
  * Ask for additional examples
  * Share experiences or make relevant comments
  * The agent responds naturally while keeping the conversation focused on learning

* **Lesson Progression:** The agent guides users through a pre-defined sequence of lessons, tracking progress and adapting to their pace.
* **Progress Management:** Users can reset their progress to restart lessons for practice purposes.

#### **Lesson Management System**

* **Dynamic Lesson Structure:** Lessons are stored in a database as **guidance documents** rather than strict scripts. Each lesson provides the agent with learning objectives and teaching material.

* **Editable Content:** A simple admin interface allows non-technical users to create, read, update, and delete lessons.

* **Lesson Components:** Each lesson is structured as a knowledge base that includes:
    * `lesson_id`: Unique identifier for the lesson
    * `title`: Lesson title (e.g., "Basic Greetings", "Restaurant Conversations")
    * `description`: Brief overview of what the lesson teaches
    * `target_language`: Language being taught (e.g., "en" for English)
    * `difficulty_level`: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced
    * `estimated_duration`: Expected lesson length (10-20 minutes)
    * `learning_objectives`: List of specific phrases, words, or concepts to teach
    * `teaching_guidance`: Instructions for the agent on how to teach this material
    * `example_conversations`: Sample dialogues demonstrating the concepts
    * `translations`: Multilingual content for all supported conversation languages
        * `greeting`: What the agent says when starting the lesson
        * `objectives_intro`: How to explain the lesson objectives
        * `teaching_points`: Key phrases and their explanations
        * `conclusion`: How to wrap up the lesson

    **Example Structure:**
    ```javascript
    {
      id: 1,
      title: "Daily Greetings",
      targetLanguage: "en",
      difficultyLevel: "beginner",

        * User's target learning language (Language A)
        * Appropriate voice for the conversation language
        * LLM configuration (temperature, model selection)
    * **Knowledge Base Management:** For each lesson, creates a knowledge base containing:
        * Lesson objectives and teaching guidance
        * Phrases to teach with usage examples
        * Example conversations and teaching strategies
        * Translated content in user's conversation language
    * **Conversation Management:**
        * Manages agent sessions for each user
        * Tracks conversation history via ElevenLabs API
        * Updates user progress based on lesson completion
        * Handles agent configuration updates when user changes languages
* **Agent Configuration:**
    * **System Prompt Template:** Dynamically generated based on user preferences
    * **Example:** *"You are a patient and encouraging language tutor. You speak exclusively in {conversationLanguage} to teach {targetLanguage}. Follow the lesson guidance provided in your knowledge base. Allow students to ask questions and interrupt. Keep conversations focused on learning objectives while being conversational and adaptive."*
