# Implementation Plan: AI Language Tutor

This document breaks down the implementation of the AI Language Tutor project into distinct tasks.

## 🔄 ARCHITECTURE CHANGE: Moving to ElevenLabs Agents Platform

The application is transitioning from a "push to talk" TTS/STT approach to using **ElevenLabs Agents Platform** for natural, conversational voice interactions. This change affects the entire architecture and requires new implementation tasks outlined below.

    *   ✅ Implement the "Push to Talk" button functionality to capture user audio.
    *   ✅ Send the captured audio to the backend `/api/conversation` endpoint.
    *   ✅ Receive the agent's audio response from the backend and play it back to the user.
    *   ✅ Implement visual feedback for listening, processing, and speaking states.
